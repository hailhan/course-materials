    "\n",
    "Let's say that we wanted to detect objects in an image, extract text from images. We could write and train our own classifiers, run our classifier on a server (e.g. an EC2 instance) and use this to make predictions. This requires a lot of time and energy in selecting the appropriate hardware, software, techniques, etc. necessary to perform these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, all the major cloud providers offer serverless \"functions as a service\" which are pre-trained/coded models that you simply need to provide data to and you will receive a response. Your cloud provider (e.g. AWS) will spin up the compute instances necessary to actually run the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can access all of these through the AWS Console, but it is easier to integrate them into your existing code via the Boto3 SDK."

We'll revisit the question of how to scale out these batch workflows further when introduce AWS [Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html), which can orchestrate large, embarrassingly parallel code execution across many Lambda workers entirely in cloud (i.e. no local bottleneck!)."
